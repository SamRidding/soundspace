# Sound Space

## Overview

Sound Space is a fictional music streaming platform which enables users to share their music with one another via their own profile. Users can follow each others profiles and engage with their content either by liking, commenting or reposting.

The target audience is wide as it encompasses music fans and artists/producers of any genre of music, essentially meaning anyone with a passion for music. The social media element to it will appeal more to younger demographics, however music fans of any age will find use from the site.

Due to time restraints and limited cloud storage the site does not give users the ability to upload their own audio files to the database, instead tracks are embedded using links from existing websites to represent this.
